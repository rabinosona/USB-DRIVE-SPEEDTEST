Hello! This program is a wrapper for a dd command in linux. To build this program, run qmake from a console or add the sources
to the project and make "build all" option in your IDE.
The program is Linux-only, it won't compile on Windows, because it uses Linux-specific libraries and commands.
In current version there you can't change the block sizes and their count, but I'll fix it later. Now it writes about 4 gigs of
data to your flash drive and works pretty fair.
If you have found any bugs, write me to the:
